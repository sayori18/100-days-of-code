# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 05, 2025

**Today's Progress**: I set up git, connected SHH, and wrote out a cheat sheet of commands for git.

**Thoughts:** It was confusing and difficult at first, but I forced myself to understand the topic so that I could use Git and GitHub properly. I had a little experience using Git earlier, and I remembered some information.

**Link to work:** I layout a simple layout, and html is still in process. Hopefully I'll be able to show off my creation soon.


### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link(s) to work**: [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)


### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
